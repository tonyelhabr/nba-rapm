# Introduction

This primary goal of this project is to calculate 
[Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-rapm/) 
(RAPM)---an "advanced statistic"---for NBA players. 
The calculated values can be found in the set of `rapm_estimates` 
CSVs in the project's repository.

I've written about this project in more detail [on my blog](https://tonyelhabr.rbind.io).
so I encourage the reader to read more about it there.
