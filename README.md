# Introduction

This primary goal of this project is to calculate 
[Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-rapm/) 
(RAPM)---an "advanced statistic"---for NBA players. 
The calculated values can be found in the set of `rapm_estimates` 
CSVs in the project's repository.

I've written about this project in more detail [on my blog](https://tonyelhabr.rbind.io).
so I encourage the reader to read more about it there.

# TODO(?)

+ [x] Check that filtering in `munge` function is done correctly.
+ [x] Try no intercept with `{glmnet}` model. UPDATE: It returns weird results.
+ [x] Check/emultate how `{glmnet}` is used at:
    + https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts/blob/3e1e3d0e14abdff00ae1493d4273e8f3b49a0a77/medium-datasci.Rmd
    + https://github.com/juliasilge/blog_by_hugo/blob/f847b7836bfcedc396e7e82867c4601ae8357853/content/blog/2018/2018-12-24-tidy-text-classification.Rmd
+ [x] Re-do calculations to follow code shown at
    + https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/
    + https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-ii-basic-application-to-2017-nba-data-with-r/.
    + https://squared2020.com/2018/12/24/regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-part-iii-what-had-really-happened-was/
        + Note: I'm 99% confident that I'm not making the additive rating mistake identified in the article
        (because I calculate `pp100poss` AFTER summing `pts` across all possessions `n`).
        + Maybe try combining offensive and defensive matrices(?), although Jacobs seems to take opinions on both sides
        of the argument of whether or not this should be done.
+ [ ] Re-do `clean` and `munge` functions with `{data.table}` (and use S3 methods to differentiate with `{tibble}` methods).
+ [ ] Compare calculations with those at http://nbashotcharts.com/ (e.g. http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=1113190703 for 2017 season)
+ [ ] Create function to automatically plot ORAPM vs. DRAPM. (Code/logic is already in
one of the `.Rmd` files.)
+ [ ] LOW PRIORITY: Create function to regenerate profile html widgets.
(Code/logic already exists somewhere in the project.)
+ [ ] Implement RAPM that considers both offense and defense simulatenously(?)
+ [ ] Move filtering function to last step before fitting (so that `munge` step
can possibly be skipped).
+ [ ] Evaluate variance of coefficients.
+ [ ] Standardize dummy/indicator variables for players in stints by number of possessions(?)
